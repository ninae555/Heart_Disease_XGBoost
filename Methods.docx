The data for our project comes from a 2020 survey of 400,000 adults conducted by the CDC that asks about heart disease status, demographics, and a variety of indicators for heart disease such as BMI and smoking.
18 variables, including the outcome variable, are included in the data set.
We are specifically focusing on the how the quality of one's mental health impacts their probability of having heart disease.
Because our outcome variable is a binary variable, we use a logit regression to examine the probability.
